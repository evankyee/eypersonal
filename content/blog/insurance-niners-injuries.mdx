## Quick Thoughts on the 49ers Season

Before jumping into the more nuanced topic, I feel compelled to use allocate the intro to a reflection on the 2025-26 49ers season (I promise it's *somewhat* relevant and not just a rant).

I've been a 49ers fan my whole life. That Vernon Davis touchdown against the Saints in the playoffs was one of the most memorable moments in my childhood. Yet, despite the fourth highest point differential over seven seasons which includes 2 Super Bowl appeareances, five playoff appearances, and four NFC championship games, we simply cannot get over the hump.

Although there is inherent variance in sports outcomes, with many confounding variables, the bizzare and perennial injury woes of the Niners continues to be the most obvious culprit for the many "almosts." Moreover, these injuries seem independently distributed for each player; it's frequently different players hurt from one season to the next (diminishing the merit of "fragility" concerns for individuals). We will later quantify the true absurdity of the 49ers health misfortunes.

Many theories, between tissue-melting EMF exposure to scheduling conspiracies, have circulated with varying degrees of virality and sensibility. These, to me, exhibit the human proclivity to ascribe blame to the statistically inexplicable. In the past seven seasons, the 49ers have been top-five in AGL (adjusted games lost) six times while no other team has finished top-five more than twice in that span except the Jets with 3. The only season where the 49ers were not among the five most injured NFL teams was 2023 where the 49ers lost in OT of the Super Bowl to the Chiefs. What is more remarkable is the sustained success of the 49ers despite their injuries (no team has a larger error for LinReg between AGL and losses. Also, I know the correlation is certainly non-linear).

Assuming injuries are purely random, the probability of finishing top five in injuries *at least* 6/7 years is ~.0088%. Even over a 59 year span, the probability of this injury streak at any point is .32%. Multiply .0088 by the probability of finishing among the top 2-4 teams almost every year and adjust for the negative correlation between injuries and success and we find ourselves with a true anomaly in America's favorite sport.

This season, culminating in a divisional round loss to Seattle, feels more malign and pernicious than those past. Perhaps it's because the gruesome conclusion imbues in fans a somber and hollow resignation that our stars are aging or leaving and that our glory years of gushing talent were oft-ruined by freak injuries right at the death of each season.

## Hedging Against injuries

The funny thing about sports teams is that they're supposed to be **all in** for winning. For an NFL team and its players, they have unequivocal financial exposure to injury risk--the bonuses, contract incentives, team value, ticket sales, and incremental merchandise and experience revenue all depend on team success (which we discovered is correlated to staying healthy). One might surmise that a team would want to hedge this financial exposure to freak injuries--especially a team like the 49ers.

The simplest way this is done today is with injury insurance. These insurance packages...NOT DONE YET
