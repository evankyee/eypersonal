Welcome! This is your personal website built with Next.js. Here's how to make it your own.

## Customizing content

### Home page

Edit `app/page.tsx` to update your bio and about section. The text there is just placeholder content - replace it with your own story.

### Links section

In `components/Links.tsx`, you'll find the links section. Update the URLs and descriptions to point to your social media profiles and other places you want to share.

### Footer

Update `components/Footer.tsx` with your actual social media handles.

## Adding blog posts

Creating a new blog post is simple:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/blog` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with title, date, and optional excerpt
3. Write your content in markdown
4. The post will automatically appear on your blog page

Example frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My new post"
date: "2024-01-15"
excerpt: "A brief description of what this post is about."
---
```

## Design philosophy

This site is intentionally minimal and focused on content. The design follows a few principles:

- **Readable typography** - Clean fonts with generous spacing
- **Minimal distractions** - No unnecessary animations or effects
- **Fast loading** - Static generation for optimal performance
- **Easy maintenance** - Simple file structure, no database needed

## Technical details

The site is built with:

- **Next.js 14** with the App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **MDX** for blog posts

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

That's it! Enjoy your new site.



. Blockquotes (indented italic sections)
Just use standard markdown > syntax:
> This helps explain how carefree people can be in assuming the CLT> applies, sometimes even when they haven't looked at the distributions:> convergence really doesn't take much.
This will render with the gold left border and  italic styling like in that screenshot.
2. Sidenotes (right margin footnotes)
Use the <Sidenote> component inline in your text:
This claim carries some risk, because assuming an inappropriatetheoretical distribution shields your reasoning from reality.<Sidenote id={1}>Conditioning on a hypothesis based on a theoretical distribution is a way to simplify calculations but it also establishes a worldview where plausible outcomes are practically impossible.</Sidenote>
On desktop: appears in the right margin
On mobile: tap the number to expand it inline
3. Math equations
Inline math (within a sentence):
The probability is approximately $P(X \geq 6) \approx 0.0088\%$
Block math (centered on its own line):
$$P(\text{top 5 at least 6 of 7 years}) = \sum_{k=6}^{7} \binom{7}{k} \left(\frac{5}{32}\right)^k \left(\frac{27}{32}\right)^{7-k}$$
Example for your 49ers post
Here's how you might use all three in insurance-niners-injuries.mdx:
Assuming injuries are purely random, the probability of finishing top five in injuries *at least* 6/7 years is approximately $0.0088\%$.<Sidenote id={1}>Calculated using the binomial distribution with $n=7$, $k \geq 6$, and $p = 5/32$.</Sidenote>> This helps explain how carefree people can be in assuming the CLT> applies, sometimes even when they haven't looked at the distributions.The expected value can be written as:$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \cdot P(x_i)$$
Run npm install when you're ready, and these features will all work!
