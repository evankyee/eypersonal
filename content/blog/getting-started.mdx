Welcome! This is your personal website built with Next.js. Here's how to make it your own.

## Customizing content

### Home page

Edit `app/page.tsx` to update your bio and about section. The text there is just placeholder content - replace it with your own story.

### Links section

In `components/Links.tsx`, you'll find the links section. Update the URLs and descriptions to point to your social media profiles and other places you want to share.

### Footer

Update `components/Footer.tsx` with your actual social media handles.

## Adding blog posts

Creating a new blog post is simple:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/blog` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with title, date, and optional excerpt
3. Write your content in markdown
4. The post will automatically appear on your blog page

Example frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My new post"
date: "2024-01-15"
excerpt: "A brief description of what this post is about."
---
```

## Design philosophy

This site is intentionally minimal and focused on content. The design follows a few principles:

- **Readable typography** - Clean fonts with generous spacing
- **Minimal distractions** - No unnecessary animations or effects
- **Fast loading** - Static generation for optimal performance
- **Easy maintenance** - Simple file structure, no database needed

## Technical details

The site is built with:

- **Next.js 14** with the App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **MDX** for blog posts

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```

That's it! Enjoy your new site.
