This is a sample blog post to get you started. You can edit this file or create new ones in the `content/blog` directory.

## Writing in MDX

MDX allows you to write markdown with React components. It's a great way to create rich, interactive content.

Here are some things you can do:

- Write lists like this one
- Add **bold** and *italic* text
- Include `inline code`
- And much more

## Code blocks

You can also include code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Links and formatting

You can add [links](https://example.com) and format text however you like.

> Blockquotes work too, perfect for highlighting important thoughts or quotes.

To create a new post, simply add a new `.mdx` file to the `content/blog` directory with frontmatter at the top.
