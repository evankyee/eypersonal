## Why Am I Doing This

For our fundraising process, I did a bit of freestyle writing that some VCs seemed to appreciate. It felt refreshing to attempt to formalize some of my oft-abstract and messy thinking. However, despite the stream-of-consciousness nature of those memos, they were still creatively and structurally burdened by an underlying motivation to imbue conviction in capital allocators (many of whom made me realize VC brains are bimodally distributed).

Regardless, I rediscovered the importance of writing in my cognitive health. Even though I spent little of my free time during college writing, and took the bare minimum for humanities credits (turns out a triple major in ECE, Math, and CS + premed requirements won't make you a renaissance man), it has always held a special place in my heart.

Over the past few months, I've spent a lot of time formulating hypotheses and testing them techincally and socially. Building something both novel and with high utility is unsurprisingly challenging. Yet, I realized I have little documentation of my challenges, my hypotheses, and my ever-changing worldview.

Because there is an absence of documentation, I suffer from failed opportunities to effectively learn from my experiences and commit those learnings to my decision-making process and intellectual repertoire. 

For myself, this writing will primarily be a thought exercise and an attempt to apply structure to to my unstructured mind. Although many founders (and seemingly everyone in tech/venture) purport writing as a means of organizing thinking, I'd contend that the true motive is self-marketing: hiring, dealflow, customers. It appears, in today's world, long-form blogs = knows what they're talking about. 

Importantly, my writing will be non-publicized (that means no LinkedIn promotions), only on my website blog, and subject-agnostic. It often will have nothing to do with my work. I believe posting does enable a *pull* mechanism yet still avoids a *push* that arises from Substack / LinkedIn / Twitter. It will also be free of any AI-assistance (even in researching material). This last fact is important for the preservation of my sanity. In my day-to-day, I already use Claude and Gemini almost gluttonously. This routine will serve as a pseudo-escapist ritual...no SEO optimization, no LinkedIn virality, no intellectual crutches. There are no intended audiences and therefore no editing (I'm in markdown without spellcheck).

I do not have a PhD. I have not (yet) made a unicorn nor a grand contribution to the math / science community. I am not a portfolio manager nor a staff-level engineer. I simply have some experience and interest in math, computer architecture, chemistry, quantitative trading, applied AI/ML, and healthcare. This will inform the subject-matter and depth of understanding.

note-to-self: work on brevity. Avoid redundancy. Don't repeat yourse--

## Memory, Writing, and Auto-Encoders.

Obviously, lots of my daily dev work is done in Claude Code now. Experientially, it can feel somewhat unstimulating. I imagine this is what most non-technical work feels like: unrigorous trial and error without that *satisfaction* only derived from using one's brain to solve a puzzle with one's creativity. I'm not entirely sure how to recapture that joy I felt in 350 or 552. 

I digress. I use Claude a *lot*. One feature I've seen remarkable improvement in is the auto-compacting of my conversations. Little context window capacity is an obvious way to degrade model performance. However, in-context learning is a ____ READ ATTN PAPER

taking lots of info and distilling it down in compression.

Wonder if there's a garbage collection system for memory rather than raw compression. Like a de-noising audoencoder. 

For myself, distilling my experiences into memory is certainly lossy, especially with long term memory. Therefore, I am trying to build an alternative autoencoding system in my life, where I can recreate the bottleneck layer (my writing) to apply more broadly (world)

Realized no documentation, imperfect learnings.

push vs pull for thoughts, 

Forced formalization, thoguth exercise, 

This is a sample blog post to get you started. You can edit this file or create new ones in the `content/blog` directory.

## Writing in MDX

MDX allows you to write markdown with React components. It's a great way to create rich, interactive content.

Here are some things you can do:

- Write lists like this one
- Add **bold** and *italic* text
- Include `inline code`
- And much more

## Code blocks

You can also include code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Links and formatting

You can add [links](https://example.com) and format text however you like.

> Blockquotes work too, perfect for highlighting important thoughts or quotes.

To create a new post, simply add a new `.mdx` file to the `content/blog` directory with frontmatter at the top.
